# Welcome to my LL Tunes Project!

Just to clarify, LL stands for Lucas Lopes!

This project was also part of the Trybe course I'm taking in Brasil.

This app uses the Itunes API to provide a simple version of a aplication like Spotify, where you can search for any artist an listen to a preview from any music of that artist. You can also favorite your songs, listen them in the favorites pages and also set your profile.

The App uses React, Context API for global States.

The tests for this application is not finished yet, but soon enough I'll do this!

Thanks for taking a look and make your self comfortable to clone this repository and see it running in your computer!

Here ar some pictures from the application:
